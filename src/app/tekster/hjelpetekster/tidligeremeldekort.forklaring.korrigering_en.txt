You may correct the last five employment status forms you have previously sent us. In order to do this, you choose the form that you wish to correct in the list below. If you correct an employment status form that has already been calculated, we will recalculate to see if the sum is still correct. The process of recalculating may take some time. We will get in contact with you if we need further information or documentation.
