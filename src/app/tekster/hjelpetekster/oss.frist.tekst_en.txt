Final submission deadline is Monday one week after the period on the employment status form (Monday week 4) at 23:00 h.

If you have passed your normal submission deadline without sending the employment status form, you can visit “Ditt NAV” and find the final submission deadline without reduced payout.

If you submit your employment status form later that the provided deadline, your submission is too late. Unemployment benefits and work assessment allowance will be reduced. You lose the right to benefits from the normal submission date (Monday week 3) until the day you actually send the employment status form, folketrygdloven § 4-8 and § 11-7.
