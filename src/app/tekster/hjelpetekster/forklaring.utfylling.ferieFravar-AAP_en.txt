Absence from work due to quarantine should be registered in the same way as illness. This does not apply when you are working from home.

</p></b>

You need to register if other reasons than your illness have made you unable to take on jobs or to participate in agreed activities.
<br>
<br>
This applies e.g. to Holidays. This also applies if you stay abroad without NAVs approval.
If you are a national of an EU/EEA-country and you have a temporary residence in another EU/EEA- country, you will not need approval by NAV.
<br>
<br>
This also applies if you wish to be unavailable to NAV on days without any agreed activities.
<br>
<br>
If you want to keep your work assessment allowance during absence, you have to contact NAV.
