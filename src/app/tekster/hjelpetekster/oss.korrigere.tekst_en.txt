I registered wrong working hours on the employment status form. Can I correct the information?

Before you send the employment status form, you see a summary of the information you have registered. Please always verify that the information is correct. You may at any time correct the information on the employment status form.

When you have registered an employment status form you may correct the forms we have received from you covering the last ten weeks. In order to do this, you choose the form that you wish to correct in the list of previously registered forms. If you correct an employment status form that has already been calculated, we will recalculate to see if the sum is still correct. The process of recalculating may take some time. We will get in contact with you if we need further information or documentation. If the employment status form has not yet been calculated we will use the new information for the calculation.
