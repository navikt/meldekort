You must register the hours you have been working and received pensionable income, even if you are self-employed. This applies to all days of the week, including Saturday and Sunday, regardless if it is day, evening or night.
<br>
<br>
The exception is if you are paid for a higher number of hours than you have actually worked. You then need to register the amount of hours you are paid for. 
<br>
<br>
If you work a specific percentage, convert it to hours. A full time job is normally 37.5 hours per week.
<br>
<br>
Please contact NAV if you
<ul>
<li>are unsure how many hours to register</li>
<li>have an occupation where 37,5 hours per week is not standard</li>
<li>participate in part-time employment schemes or measures where you receive payment</li>
</ul>
