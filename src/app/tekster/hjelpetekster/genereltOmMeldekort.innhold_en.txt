<b>When is submission deadline?</b>
<p>
You must submit the employment status form at the scheduled submission day. Scheduled submission day is the first Monday after the period on the status form (Monday week 3).
You may already submit the employment status form the last Saturday or Sunday on the status form (Saturday/Sunday week 2).
</p>
<p>
You find your next submission deadline at “Ditt NAV”.
</p>
<a name=siste_frist></a>
<b>When is final submission deadline without reduced payout?</b>
<p>
Final submission deadline is Monday one week after the period on the employment status form (Monday week 4) at 23:00 h.
</p>
<p>
If you have passed your normal submission deadline without sending the employment status form, you can visit “Ditt NAV” and find the final submission deadline without reduced payout.
</p>
<p>
If you submit your employment status form later that the provided deadline, your submission is too late. Unemployment benefits and work assessment allowance will be reduced. You lose the right to benefits from the normal submission date (Monday week 3) until the day you actually send the employment status form, folketrygdloven § 4-8 and § 11-7.

<b>Is it possible to correct the information on the employment status form?</b>
<p>
I registered wrong working hours on the employment status form. Can I correct the information?
</p>
<p>
Before you send the employment status form, you see a summary of the information you have registered. Please always verify that the information is correct. You may at any time correct the information on the employment status form.
</p>
<p>
When you have registered an employment status form you may correct the forms we have received from you covering the last ten weeks. In order to do this, you choose the form that you wish to correct in the list of previously registered forms. If you correct an employment status form that has already been calculated, we will recalculate to see if the sum is still correct. The process of recalculating may take some time. We will get in contact with you if we need further information or documentation. If the employment status form has not yet been calculated we will use the new information for the calculation.

<b>When do I get the payment?</b>
<p>
Payout occurs 1-2 business days after receiving your employment status form, provided that you have been  granted the benefits.
</p>
<p>
At “Ditt NAV” you will see whether your benefits have been calculated or not based on your employment status form.
</p>
<p>
If your payment is not calculated the day after sending the employment status form, please contact NAV at 55 55 33 33 to clarify what has happened.

<b>How much will I receive?</b>
<p>
When your employment status form is calculated, you can see gross payment at “Ditt NAV”.
</p> 
<p>
Gross payment is the benefits before tax and other withholdings. The amount is calculated based on your daily rate (from the decision on your benefit) and the information you have given on the employment status form.
</p>
<p>
Do you want to see more details on the calculated benefits, tax and other withholdings, please go to “Dine utbetalinger”.
