If you are unable to work due to contagion or as a result of contagion-preventing measures, this will not be deducted from your benefits. Therefore, do not register this as absence.
</p></b>
You need to register if other reasons than your illness have made you unable to take on jobs.
<br>
<br>
This also applies if you wish to be unavailable to take on jobs during days without any agreed activities.
<br>
<br>
Absence normally leads to reduced benefits.
<br>
<br>
You are not entitled to unemployment benefits as long as you stay abroad, unless NAV in advance has accepted that you are covered by an exception rule. You must check the days you stay abroad.
